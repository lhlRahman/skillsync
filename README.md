# Skill Sync

## A platform that connects volunteers to those needing volunteers

Using Cohere AI technology, our platform simplifies and personalizes search for volunteering opportunities to give volunteers the power to pursue specific roles and enhance their skill sets.

When volunteers sign up for the platform, they create an entry about past experiences they’ve enjoyed and excelled at (whether that’s from a school team, club or hobby).
Using these short entries and the Cohere Rerank API, which uses Semantic Searching to query big data, volunteers can view postings through two different priorities. They can either prioritize roles that match their current skill set and will allow them to strengthen them, or they can prioritize roles that introduce new skills they might’ve not yet had the opportunity to acquire.
Then when applying to a volunteer posting, these entries are used in conjunction with the job descriptions to generate starting applications that can be built off and altered.

As well for those in need of volunteers, they can write simple volunteer role descriptions, which can then be enhanced for their actual postings. These enhanced postings introduce details and enthusiasm, making them more attractive to potential volunteers.

## Through the power of volunteer work, we will not just better our cities, but give youth in cities the opportunities to expand their skill sets.
